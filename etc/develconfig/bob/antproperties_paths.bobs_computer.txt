# The username is the name reported to ant in the ${user.name} variable.

# Applications

# Path to the installation folder of Proguard. Please note that the core
# libraries have only been tested with Proguard 4.3. A known issue exists
# with Proguard 4.4 which causes the libraries to become corrupt. No further
# investigation has been done into why it happens.
path.tools.proguard=/usr/devel/proguard4.3

# The path to the installation folder of JUnit. Please note that the JUnit tests
# only been tested with JUnit 4.6. They should most likely work with newer
# versions as well.
path.tools.junit=/usr/devel/junit4.6

# only be run if the "teamcity" target in the build.xml file is invoked.
